This is only for puppeteer which I decided not to use.  Left here as it is already in GIT and I might need to use it later.

Install node
install jre
install jdk
install latest version of puppeteer

run node start.js

to update puppeteer use 
    
    npm install --ignore-scripts puppeteer
    npm init
    npm install puppeteer

all that ignore certs and NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS I couldn't get to work.
